#AgROS Frontend

## Description
This is a web-based frontend for interacting with the AgROS system. AgROS
is an effort to make an extensible agricultural robotics system on the ROS
framework.

The frontend allows you to view the basic status of the system and the next
waypoint. You can issue basic controls as well as a soft stop. You can load
a set of waypoints or draw a region to automatically create one. Everything
is visualized in a map on the dashboard.

## System
The system is built on Angular. To view the dependencies of the project,
please take a look at `angular/package.json`.
